Welcome to the Wave to Earth website!
This is an ultimate online destination designed exclusively for Wave to Earth fans, plankton. This project aims to create a visually stunning and immersive website that serves as a central hub for fans and newcomers to explore, engage and connect with the band. With sleek user interface design and seamless integration through this website, the Wave to Earth website will provide a unique digital experience, showcasing the band's discography, upcoming events, and a captivating gallery that captures the essence of Wave to Earth's musically identity.

## Design Process
Our design process revolves around understanding the needs and desires of Wave to Earth's diverse audience. Through user stories, I have identified key functionalities to ensure an optimal user experience:
* As a to-be fan, I want to easily access the band's discography, so that I can discover and enjoy their entire musical catalog.
* As an event-goer, I want to stay informed about their upcoming concerts and events, so that I can plan to attend and experience Wave to Earth Live.

As part of the design process, we have created wireframes to visualise and plan the user interface. Below, you will find links to wireframes created using Figma.

## Features
In this section, I would go over the different parts of the website.

### Existing Features
* Feature 1: **About**  
  The "About" section provides users with a comprehensive overview of Wave to Earth, detailing the band's history, members, and their unique musical journey.
  * Hovering over each member's profile image triggers an enlargement effect, accompanied by a cursor change to a pointing finger, indicating click ability. Clicking on the images opens a new tab, directing users to their respective Instagram profiles. This interactive feature allows users to delve deeper into each member's background and personality.

* Feature 2: **Music**  
  The "Music" feature allows fans and newcomers to explore the band's discography, providing a curated collection of albums and songs. Fans can easily discover and enjoy Wave to Earth's entire musical catalogue.
  * A featured YouTube video within this section showcases the latest album release, inviting fans or newcomers to click and listen. Additionally, adjacent to the video, the band's album or episode discography is displayed. Each album and its title exhibit an enlargement effect upon hovering, providing users with more information. Clicking on any album directs users to the respective Spotify page, allowing them to listen to the selected album.

* Feature 3: **Tour**  
  The "Tour" section keeps event-goers informed about upcoming concerts and events, allowing them to plan and experience Wave to Earth live.
  * In this section, the tour dates are showcased in an organised manner, displaying the day, date, and location of each event. Accompanying each entry are buttons labelled "TICKET". Upon hovering, these buttons change colour, indicating to users that they are clickable. Clicking on these buttons directs users to the ticketing website, opening a new tab for a seamless ticket-purchasing experience. Additionally, there is also a recorded video background of Wave to Earth's past concert, providing a glimpse into the band's live performances.
    
* Feature 4: **Merch**  
  In the "Merch" section, fans can explore and purchase exclusive merchandise, fostering a deeper connection with the band and providing a concrete way to support their favourite artists.
  * Each merch item and its name have an interactive feature. The image of each merch has an enlarging effect upon hovering, and the name of the merch changes from black and white, adding a dynamic visual element to the user experience, indirectly signalling to users that these elements are clickable and encouraging further exploration.

* Feature 5: **Sign Up**  
  The "Sign Up" feature enables users to join the community, ensuring they stay updated on the latest releases, tour dates, and exclusive content.
  * Over here, users can sign up by filling up the form. When done, there is a pop-up message that says "Thank you for signing up!". It also displays an error message when users try clicking on the sign-up button without entering anything into the form. This provides a clear and informative feedback mechanism for user interactions.

## Technologies Used
In this section, I will be mentioning all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that I have used to construct this project. 
* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
  - HTML is the standard markup language fo creating web pages. It helps with the structuring of content on the web and is a fundamental part of building web pages.
  
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
  - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling and layouting web pages. It controls the visual presentation of the HTML elements, enhancing the project's aesthetic appeal and user experience.
  - This project uses @media queries in CSS to ensure optimal viewing and interactions across various devices and screen sizes.

* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
  - JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive web pages. It is used to implement features, handle events, and enhance user interaction in this project.
  - The webpage utilizes JavaScript for a pop-up feature triggered when users sign up, displaying a "Thank you for signing up!" message.
  - Additionally, JavaScript is utilized for scroll animations and styling changes, dynamically adjusting the header's size, position, and content presentation based on the user's scroll behavior, enhancing the overall visual appeal and navigation experience.

## Testing
1. Sign-up Form:
   * Go to the Sign-up section.
   * Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears.
   * Try to submit the form with an invalid email address (e.g., no '@' or '.com') and verify that a relevant error message appears.

In this section, I will be highlighting the responsiveness of my website, ensuring optimal user experience across various browsers and screen sizes. My website has been designed and tested to be compatible with both phone-sized screens and traditional computer screens. The responsive design adapts seamelssly to different resolutions, ensuring that users can enjoy a consistent user-friendly interface whether they access the site from a smartphone or computer. This commitment to responsiveness enhances accessbility and usability, contributing to a positive and inclusive user experience across diverse devices.
